# WINDSAFS RULES

## Context and Preparation

1. **Consult Context Systems**
   - Before starting any task, always consult the **MCP of Vectoreze** and **Context7**.
   - Purpose: obtain the most updated and detailed context about the project and current objectives.
   - If either system is unavailable or unclear, log the issue and request clarification before proceeding.

2. **Review Documentation**
   - Check all relevant `.md` files and related project notes.
   - Understand previous design decisions, coding patterns, and naming conventions.
   - If information is missing, inconsistent, or outdated, update the corresponding file.
   - Keep all Markdown files consistent, current, and well-structured.

3. **Confirm Understanding**
   - Before execution, summarize the task in your own words.
   - Ensure that the interpretation matches project intent or request confirmation when uncertain.

## Task Execution

4. **Initialization Phrase**
   - Always begin new executions with the phrase:
     ```
     ok boneco
     ```
   - This signals standardized task start for coordination and tracking purposes.

5. **Consistency and Standards**
   - Follow all established conventions for code, documentation, and formatting.
   - Maintain naming, file structure, and logic alignment with existing systems.
   - If deviation is necessary, document the reason clearly within the task log or update notes.

6. **Reasoning and Tracking**
   - Use explicit reasoning when making decisions.
   - Keep a record of analysis steps, rejections, and alternatives considered.
   - Purpose: ensure traceability and reproducibility across systems and sessions.

## Post-Execution

7. **Task Summary**
   - After finishing a task:
     - Summarize what was completed and why.
     - List any relevant updates to structure, logic, or documentation.
     - If follow-up is required, include a `TODO` or update the corresponding `.md` file.

8. **Avoid Redundancy**
   - Reference existing documentation instead of duplicating information.
   - Only repeat text if necessary for clarity or isolation of context.

9. **Transparency and Consistency**
   - Maintain a clear and consistent communication pattern across all outputs.
   - Record all changes in a format that other IAs or processes can interpret reliably.

## Optional Extensions (If Supported)

- **CHECKPOINTS**
  - For complex or multi-step tasks, define clear checkpoints:
    ```
    CHECKPOINT 1: Data validation
    CHECKPOINT 2: Context merge
    CHECKPOINT 3: Output synthesis
    ```

- **Standardized Tags**
  - Use these when applicable:
    ```
    NOTE: General observations or clarifications.
    WARNING: Potential errors, limitations, or conflicts.
    TODO: Pending actions or required follow-ups.
    REF: Linked documentation or source reference.
    ```
